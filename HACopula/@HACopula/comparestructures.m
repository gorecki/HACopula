function [areEqual, ratio] = comparestructures(HAC1, HAC2)
%COMPARESTRUCTURES - compare two HAC structures 
%
% areEqual = comparestructures(HAC1, HAC2) returns 1, if the structures of
% HAC1 and HAC2 are equal, otherwise, returns 0.
%
% [areEqual, ratio] = comparestructures(HAC1, HAC2) additionaly returns a
% ratio expressing a certain type of similarity between the two structures.
% This ratio is based on the trivariate decompositon of a HAC tree
% structure introduced in [Segers and Uyttendaele (2014)]
%
% NOTE:
% If one is just interested if the two structures are equal (and not in the
% ratio), one should require only the first output (areEqual), for which
% the computation method is quite fast. Otherwise, i.e., if the ratio is
% also required, a more computionally demanding method (based on the
% trivariate decompostion) is used.

    % here, for each possible triplet (nchoosek(d, 3)) of the leaves, the
    % trivariate HAC in the sense of [Segers and Uyttendaele (2014)] is
    % built/analyzed for each of the two input HACs and these are then checked to
    % match.
    %
    % Given a triplet (i, j, k), according to [Segers and Uyttendaele
    % (2014)], there can exist only four differently structured trivariate
    % HACs. The particular one can be detected using the "youngest common
    % antecendent" (yca (lca in [Segers and Uyttendaele (2014)])).
    % For the pairs (i, j), (i, k) and (j, k), the corresponding ycas can be:
    % 1) (AAB)  2) (ABA)  3) (BAA)  4) (AAA),
    % where A and B belong to the set of the TauOrdering of all forks.
    % To distinguish among these four cases, just two bits are needed:
    % I) yca(i, j) == yca(i, k) and II) yca(i, k) == yca(j, k)
    % The four cases are then identified:
    % 1) = 10  (first bit is from I) and the second from II))
    % 2) = 00
    % 3) = 01
    % 4) = 11
    %
    % Hence, to check the match of two trivariate structures, it is enough
    % to compare these two bits obtained for the first HAC to the
    % corresponding bits obtained for the second HAC.
