%FINDVARS2FLIP - Find variables to flip in order to reduce negative pairwise correlations.
%
% Returs an array of indices of variables, which should be flipped (U := 1
% -U) in order to reduce negative correlation in data corresponding to the
% Kendall correlation matrix in the input *K*. This function implements
% Algorithm 4 from [Gorecki et al., 2016a]. Note that the outputted indices
% are ordered according to how much the negative correlation is reduced by
% flipping the corresponding variable, beginning with the one that reduces
% the negative correlation the most.
